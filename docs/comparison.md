# Comparison and Motivations

APIFlask starts as a fork of APIFairy (which share similar APIs with flask-smorest)
and is inspired by flask-smorest and FastAPI. So, what are the differences between
APIFlask and APIFairy/flask-smorest/FastAPI?

In a word, I try to provide an elegant (act as a framework, no need to instantiate
additional extension object) and simple (more automation support for OpenAPI/API
documentation) solution for creating web APIs with Flask. Here is a summary of the
differences between APIFlask and similar projects.


## APIFlask vs FastAPI

- For the web part, FastAPI builds on top of Starlette, while APIFlask builts on top of
  Flask.
- For the data part (serialization/deserialization, OpenAPI support), FastAPI relies
  on Pydantic, while APIFlask supports both Pydantic models and marshmallow-code projects (marshmallow, webargs, apispec) through a pluggable adapter system.
- APIFlask builds on top of Flask, so it's compatible with Flask extensions.
- FastAPI supports async. APIFlask has the basic async support with Flask 2.0.
- APIFlask provides more decorators to help organize things better.
- FastAPI injects the input data as an object, while APIFlask passes it as a dict.
- APIFlask has built-in class-based views support based on Flask's `MethodView`.
- On top of Swagger UI and Redoc, APIFlask supports more API documentation tools:
  Elements, RapiDoc, and RapiPDF.


## APIFlask vs APIFairy/flask-smorest


### APIFlask is a framework

Although APIFlask is a thin wrapper on top of Flask, it's actually a framework.
Thus, there is no need to instantiate additional extension object:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_api_extension import APIExtension

app = Flask(__name__)
api = APIExtension(app)
```

You only need to use the `APIFlask` class to replace the `Flask` class:

```python
from apiflask import APIFlask

app = APIFlask(__name__)
```

The key reasons behind making APIFlask a framework instead of a Flask
extension is it makes possible to overwrite and change the internal
behavior of Flask. For example:

- Rewrite `Flask.dispatch_request` to ensure the natural order of the arguments
injected into the view function (APIFlask 1.x).
- Add route shortcuts to the `Flask` and the `Blueprint` class (added in Flask 2.0).
- Rewrite `Flask.make_response` to support returning list as JSON response (added in Flask 2.2).
- Rewrite `Flask.add_url_rule` to support generating OpenAPI spec for class-based views.


### More automation for OpenAPI generating

- Add an auto-summary for the view function based on the name of view functions.
- Add success response (200) for a bare view function that only uses route decorators.
- Add validation error response (400) for view functions that use `input` decorator.
- Add authentication error response (401) for view functions that use `auth_required` decorator.
- Add 404 response for view functions that contain URL variables.
- Add response schema for potential error responses of view function passed with `doc` decorator. For example, `doc(responses=[404, 405])`.
- etc.

!!! tip

    These automation behaviors can be changed with related
    [configuration variables](/configuration).


### More features

- Add a `doc` decorator to allow set the OpenAPI spec for view functions in an explicit way.
- Support more OpenAPI fields (all fields from `info`, `servers`, response/requestBody/parameters `example`, path `deprecated`, etc).
- Support to customize the API documentation config and CDN URLs.
- Return JSON response for all HTTP errors and Auth errors as default.
- Class-based view support.
- etc.
