class File(Field):
    """A binary file field, it should only be used in an input schema.

    Examples:

    ```python
    import os

    from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
    from apiflask.fields import File


    class Image(Schema):
        image = File()


    @app.post('/images')
    @app.input(Image, location='files')
    def upload_image(data):
        f = data['image']
        # use `secure_filename` to clean the filename, notice it will only keep ascii characters
        filename = secure_filename(f.filename)
        f.save(os.path.join(the_path_to_uploads, filename))

        return {'message': f'file {filename} saved.'}
    ```
    The file object is an instance of `werkzeug.datastructures.FileStorage`, see more details in the
    [docs](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/datastructures/#werkzeug.datastructures.FileStorage).  # noqa: B950, E501

    Use `form_and_files` location if you want to put both files
    and other normal fields in one schema.

    ```python
    import os

    from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
    from apiflask.fields import String, File


    class ProfileIn(Schema):
        name = String()
        avatar = File()

    @app.post('/profiles')
    @app.input(ProfileIn, location='form_and_files')
    def create_profile(data):
        avatar_file = data['avatar']
        name = data['name']

        # use `secure_filename` to clean the filename, notice it will only keep ascii characters
        avatar_filename = secure_filename(avatar_file.filename)
        avatar_file.save(os.path.join(the_path_to_uploads, avatar_filename))

        profile = Profile(name=name, avatar_filename=avatar_filename)
        # ...
        return {'message': 'profile created.'}
    ```

    In the current implementation, `files` location data will also include
    the form data (equals to `form_and_files`).

    *Version Added: 1.0*

    This field accepts the same keyword arguments that `Field` receives.
